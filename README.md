# Simple Interpreter

Example Usage: `python3 simple_interpreter.py gcd.simple`

## Overview

I am writing this project for the sake of learning more about the compilers. In its current state, this project is a "simple interpreter" written in Python that interprets the made-up ".simple" language. This is an ongoing project, and I plan to further develop it into a full compiler. 

Right now, the interpreter supports functions, integer/boolean operations, and if/while/for constructs. The included example file `gcd.simple` is a recursive implementation of the Euclidean Algorithm in the ".simple" language that demonstrates these capabilites.

For further details on what features have (and have not) been implemented in the interpreter, see the *Current State* section. For details on the language specifications of the ".simple" language, see the ".simple" section.

## Current State

Right now, the interpreter consists of a three stage process (each with a corresponding directory in the project): the lexical analysis stage (Lexer), the semantic analysis stage (Parser) and the interpreter stage (Interpreter). 

The lexical analysis
